Sample.Commands()
}
\description{
This program shows how to use the main program with two illustrative samples of
data.  The first sample contains N = 500 cases, k = 12 normally distributed
continuous variables, and 3 correlated factors.  The sample commands show the
correlation matrix and the output of the EFA.Comp.Data program, which correctly
identifies 3 factors.  The second sample contains N = 500 cases, k = 8 non-normally
distributed ordinal variables, and 2 uncorrelated factors.  The sample commands show
the Pearson correlation matrix, the Spearman correlation matrix, the difference
between these matrices, the output of the EFA.Comp.Data program (first using Pearson
correlations and then using Spearman correlations).  The first run overidentifies
the number of factors, but the second correctly identifies 2 factors.
